# Garbage Pile Image Setup

To display the garbage pile image in the center of the website:

1. Save your garbage pile image as `garbage-pile.png`
2. Place it in this `/public` folder
3. The image will automatically appear centered on the white background

The image should be:
- PNG format (recommended for transparency)
- Optimal size: 800px - 1200px width
- The component will automatically resize it to fit the viewport

If the image is not found, a placeholder will be shown.
